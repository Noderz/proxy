## Quickstart:

${ti}
git clone https://github.com/sysce/proxy ./sys-proxy

node ./sys-proxy/demo
${ti}

## Installation:

${ti}
npm i sys-proxy
${ti}

### Demo:

See the [demo folder](demo/) for more usage examples

${ti}
var nodehttp = require('sys-nodehttp'),
	rewriter = require('sys-proxy'),
	server = new nodehttp.server({
		port: 7080,
		static: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
	}),
	rw = new rewriter({
		prefix: '/service',
		codec: rewriter.codec.xor,
		server: server,
		title: 'Service',
		// http_agent: ..,
		// https_agent: ..,
		// ruffle: ..,
		// adblock: ..,
	});

// [0000] server listening on http://localhost:7080/
${ti}

## API:

${docs}

## How it works:

Recieve request => parse URL => send request to server => rewrite content => send to client

### JS:

To achieve accuracy when rewriting, this proxy uses "scoping". All js is wrapped in a [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) to override variables that otherwise are not possible normally (window, document)

[Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) are used to change or extend any value to be in line with rewriting URLs

Any occurance of ${t}this${t} is changed to call the global rw_this function with the ${t}this${t} value, if the ${t}this${t} value has a property indicating that the value has a proxied version, return the proxied version.

An example:

Call the rewriter and parse:
${ti}
if(window.location == this.location)alert('Everything checks out!');
${ti}

Expected result:

${ti}
{let fills=<bundled code>,window=fills.this,document=fills.document;if(window.location == rw_this(this).location)alert('Everything checks out!');
//# sourceURL=anonymous:1
}
${ti}

${t}this${t} in the input code is defined as ${t}window${t}, the ${t}window${t} has a proxied version that will also determine if any properties are proxied and give a result.

${t}this${t} => ${t}fills.this${t}

${t}this.location${t} => ${t}fills.url${t}

#### HTML rewriting:

A part of getting down full HTML rewriting is also making sure any dynamically made elements are rewritten.

[Getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) and [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) are used for properties on the ${t}Node.prototype${t} object for such as but not limited to:

- ${t}outerHTML${t}
- ${t}innerHTML${t}
- ${t}getAttribute${t}
- ${t}setAttribute${t}
- ${t}setAttributeNS${t}
- ${t}insertAdjacentHTML${t}
- ${t}nonce${t}
- ${t}integrity${t}
+ every attribute that is rewritten in the HTML side of things

Any property/function that inserts raw html code that is not rewritten is ran through the rewriters HTML handler.
Properties are handled by the rewriters HTML property handler (for consistency)

### CSS:

A basic regex to locate all ${t}url()${t} blocks is used and the rewriters URL handler is called with the value and meta for the page

### HTML:

A bundled version of [JSDOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) is used to achieve accuracy and consistency when rewriting and [DOMParser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) in the browser.

Each property is iterated and in the rewriter a huge array containing information for determining the type of attribute being worked with is used ( this includes tag and name).

- If the type is a URL then the resulting value is determined by the rewriters URL handler
- If the type is JS then the resulting value is determined by the rewriters JS handler along with being wrapped for encoding
- If the type is CSS then the resulting value is determined by the rewriters CSS handler along

### Manifest:

A basic JSON.stringify checking if the key is ${t}src${t} or ${t}key${t} or ${t}start_url${t} and if it is then the rewriters URL handler is used to determine the result.
